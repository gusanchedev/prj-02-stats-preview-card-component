## My process

### Built with

- HTML markup and plain CSS
- Google Fonts
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I applied basic HTML and CSS concepts. The following snippets represent the principal topics learned and used:

How to apply filters to images in CSS3:
```css
.card img {
  max-width: 100%;
  filter: invert(11%) sepia(22%) saturate(918%) hue-rotate(220deg)
    brightness(70%) contrast(114%);
}
```
How to change opacity in hover state:
```css
.proceed-payment:hover {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```
How to change the order of elements with Flexbox:
```css
  .card {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    max-width: 90%;
  }
  .text-container {
    order: 1;
    flex: 0 1 50%;
    padding:initial;    
  }
  .image-container {
    order: 2;
    flex: 0 1 50%;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

```
How to adjust image size to parent container
```css
  .image-container img {
    width: 100%;
    max-height: auto;
    display: block;
  }
```

### Continued development

In the next projects I will continue using key concepts of HTML5 and CSS3. Also, my goal is to use a CSS framework like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and a new frontend development environment known as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

### Useful resources

- [Fit images to container](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container.
